oa-runner
=========

oa-runner is a collection of scripts to support runners and ramblers who want to contribute to [Open Addresses UK](http://openaddressesuk.org) by surveying addresses that are located at a given distance or nearby their planned courses.

**NOTE: this is a working prototype only**, and Open Addresses is not yet ready to automatically process the outcome of your survey (when you scan the QR codes in the survey forms). You are very welcome to feedback and contribute, though: Please use this repository's [issues section](https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/oa-runner/issues).

##Setup
- If you want to use *.fit* files:
  - Setup any recent Java runtime environment suitable to your system, so that it can run from the command line using the *java* command. This is required to run the *FitCSVTool* tool, part of the FIT SDK. We did our testing using Apple MacOS' Java SE runtime environment version 1.7.0_21.  
  - Download the FIT SDK from [http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit](http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit) and uncompress it in *etc* (e.g. *etc/FitSDKRelease13.10*).
- Install all Node.js dependencies:

	```
	npm install 
	```
- Download the latest CSV edition of Office for National Statistics' "Postcode Directory" Open Data dataset from [https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/content/filelist.page?redirect=Docs/PostCodes/](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/content/filelist.page?redirect=Docs/PostCodes/) and uncompress it in *data* (e.g. *data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv*).
- Use the *tools/drop-terminated-postcodes.js* script to drop from the above dataset all terminated postcodes and create a new file with the remaining ones, e.g.

	```
	node tools/drop-terminated-postcodes.js --in data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK.csv --out data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK_not_terminated.csv 
	```

	This process also saves to the output file the coordinates of the postcodes' centroids in the more convenient latitude / longitude format rather than ONS' northing and easting.

	Optionally, you can also drop all those postcodes that are too far away from your location to be interesting to you, e.g., in the example below, anything beyond 30 miles *as the crow flies* from the Open Addresses offices in London. This will dramatically speed up the scripts: 

	```
	node tools/drop-terminated-postcodes.js --lat=51.522342 --lon=-0.083476 --limit=30 --in=data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK.csv --out=data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK_OAoffices.csv
	```

	Don't worry if you don't know your starting point, [read here](/docs/where-am-i.md). 

- Download the JSON, one-file-per-postcode-sector edition of Open Addresses UK's addresses-only dataset from [http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/data](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/data) and uncompress it in *data* (e.g. *data/open_addresses_database_2014-12-10-openaddressesuk-addresses-only-split.json*).

##Run
###If you don't have a favourite course
The example below creates an HTML file called [*bestSurveyOption-distance.html*](samples/html/bestSurveyOption-distance.html) with the best survey option being identified to be about 3 miles (to and back) from the Open Addresses offices in London. It can take several minutes to complete, just be patient and wait :-)

Note how the optimised version of the ONSPD dataset produced following the setup instructions above **must** be used as an input.

```
> node oarunner.js --lat=51.522342 --lon=-0.083476 --distance=3 --oa=data/open_addresses_database_2014-12-10-openaddressesuk-addresses-only-split.json/ --onspd=data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK_not_terminated.csv --html=bestSurveyOption-distance.html
```

###If you have a favourite course
If you own a fitness device that can save your activity data to *.fit* format, the example below creates a HTML file called [*bestSurveyOption-course.html*](samples/html/bestSurveyOption-course.html) with the best of the address survey options identified along the course specified in the *.fit* file provided as an input. 

```
> node oarunner.js --fit=samples/fit/2014-12-24-11-11-15-Navigate.fit --fitsdk=etc/FitSDKRelease13.10/ --oa=data/open_addresses_database_2014-12-10-openaddressesuk-addresses-only-split.json/ --onspd=data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK_OAoffices.csv --html=bestSurveyOption-course.html 
```

The underlying idea is that the volunteer's mission is to get to and back from the address to be surveyed. Because of that, when specifying a course the survey options are sorted by proximity to the middle of that course. If the volunteer doesn't want the top survey option but another one (perhaps she's run that already) she can use the *--option* argument; e.g. ```--option=3``` will give her the 3rd best.

When you do not specify the *--html* argument, a JSON file with the full list of survey options is printed to screen. [You can save it to file](samples/json/allSurveyOptions-distance.json) by simply doing:

```
> node oarunner.js --lat=51.522342 --lon=-0.083476 --distance=3 --oa=data/open_addresses_database_2014-12-10-openaddressesuk-addresses-only-split.json/ --onspd=data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_csv/Data/ONSPD_NOV_2014_UK_OAoffices.csv > allSurveyOptions-distance.json
```

###The results
When saving to HTML, the output is a list of addresses suitable for surveying within the same postcode, ready for the volunteer to print and take with her. 

Each address is associated to three QR codes that the user can scan to tell Open Address what the outcome of the survey was. **Note that Open Addresses is not yet ready to collect this information** and the URLs behind the QR codes are, for the time being, just stabs.

When saving to JSON, the file is an array with all identified survey options. Each survey option is made of:

- *postcode*: describing the postcode to be investigated, its lat/lon and the course's closest point, e.g.

	```
	{
		"pcd" : "HP4 2EB",
		"lat" : 51.760489,
		"lon" : -0.557384,
		"closestPoint" : {
			"distance" : 1.6,
			"position" : {
				"_lat" : 51.760688,
				"_lon" : -0.557431,
				"_radius" : 6371
			}
		}
	}
	```

- *relevantOaAddresses*: an array of all Open Addresses addresses that belong to that postcode, in their native OA JSON format.

- *inferredAddresses*: an array of all addresses inferred for that postcode, in the OA JSON format but for the elements that could not be defined (e.g., obviously, the URI associated by OA to the addresses).

The proposed postcodes are those whose centroid is within 50 yards (can be changed using the *--deviation* command line parameter) from the target distance / running course. In theory, this means that surveying the addresses won't take the volunteer too far from her planned distance or course. When specifying a course, not all points in the course are evaluated, but one every ~220 yards (the *--sample* parameter). 

##Compatibility
- If you want to use *oa-runner* by specifying a favourite running course and you own a fitness device / watch, at the moment we support *.fit* files only. Testing was done using files created by a [Garmin FÄ“nix 2 multisport watch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/watches-wearable-technology/wearables/fenix-2/prod159116.html). We presume that their format and conventions (e.g. the column names in the *.csv* files that can be extracted from the *.fit*) will be consistent at least across other Garmin models, but did not test that yet. Do you own any other fitness device that uses the *.fit* format? Please offer your help in the [issues section](https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/oa-runner/issues).
